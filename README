Readme for SVN::TXN::Props version 1.00

properties in a subversion transaction.  When use in a pre-commit hook
script, this allows revision properties to be manipulated before the
transaction is commited to the repository, for instance by updating
the svn:author or svn:log properties.

For more details, see the pod documentation in SVN/TXN/Props.pm
